assignments

Homeworks are to be completed individually or as specified in the assignment description. If teams are permitted, teams must not exceed three students. Note that teamwork is not required for any assignment.

Unless otherwise noted, assignments are due by 11:59pm on the specified due date and are to be submitted via RPI LMS. Late assignments are penalized 20 points for being late. Late assignments may be submitted up to a maximum of 5 days (120 hours) after the deadline. Assignments cannot be accepted for credit after this 5-day grace period.
Compilation

For C programs (Homeworks #1 and #3), use gcc to compile your code and specify -Wall; all compiler warnings must be addressed (fixed) before submitting your assignment. Further, do not use any additional flags with gcc.

For C++ programs, use g++ to compile your code and, as with C, specify -Wall and ensure all compiler warnings are addressed (fixed) before submitting your assignment.

For Java programs, use javac to compile your code and java to execute it.

For any other language, please confirm language, version, libraries, etc. with me and the TAs first.
